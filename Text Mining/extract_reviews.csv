    Ok. I like the book collection. They are bright coloured, apt in size for babies older than 6 months old. But do keep in mind that if your baby is mouthing and is not familiar with books before, just introduce this book, turn the pages, show the pictures and not give it to them. Not because they can be easily torn or something but because of their salive, the pages tend to get soaked in it forming into something like the picture i am attaching. The publishers could have done something to prevent that.For my baby,who is mouthing, I now have bought a cloth book for now and intends to introduce this little library later on. Apart that minute fault, i am excited about him reading and this little library.

    Yes, your kid will be little curious at first sight. Then after they will start biting, licking these board books. Also because of the small size the kid won't recognise the images easily. I will recommend to buy the bigger size board book. Kid will love bigger board books.

    Go for this without any second thoughts. Book It's on exact size it needs to be. Very easy to carry with infants around. Sturdy. Hard covers. Pictures are real and in white background without any deviation. My baby enjoys seeing it. Good though of having all the basic topics n a single nutshell.The only con I would say is we see few repetitive objects across all the books. I e Brocolli n vegetables and in Green colour as well. This might be corrected to include as many new words/ pictures as possible. Otherwise great buy. No regrets.

    Kids are visual learners and ever since I bough this for my 2.5 year old daughter, she always keeps bringing these books and eagerly enquires about the contents.She learned the names of animals and colours fast, thanks to this library.

    The book is nice and I bought it for my year toddler he enjoyed it and developed a liking for it, by just asking him to bring his books he could signal for the library but after a month instead of looking at the books he started nibbling on it, as the books are hardbound he was able to swallow the cardboard making the edges soggy. I have to keep it away now. I try interacting with him orally but somehow I want him to get acquainted with books. The only thing I wish was if the books were washable.

    The book box is really good. Initially, my daughter kept playing with it to remove the book and put it back.The book's classification is well thought to give a kid a flavor of different things to visualize. There are minor pictures which could have been done better - such as having pictures of things which we Indians can visualize, and for Nest word, the picture is of a nest with big eggs and everyone's eyes will go on eggs rather than a nest. Anyway, this is quite a minor issue which we will observe in any best books. The book size is small which is just to know before buying but handly for a kid. Overall the quality of information, book, and book box quality make it work buying for a 2-3 years kid.

    All the books are very attractive. Images give real feel of animals etc. My 10 months old baby enjoys a lot. He spends a lot of time on these books. Good learning for babies. Though the books are easy to use, (corners are soft etc.) by small babies, but still they can torn if used regularly. Then there are chances they might put or swallow small paper parts of book in their mouth. So keep an eye. Otherwise books are very good.

    This is an excellent program for kid. Quality is good. Only thing I would like that it should have Indian touch in it, rather than US. For example it should have Indian fruits , Indian vegetables, Indian vehicles, Indian pets etc in it. Also ‚ÄòBhindi‚Äô should be ‚ÄòLady Finger‚Äô , not Okra

    I'm not going to lie! They are small books but, board books usually comes in this size.For the price point, this purely is a gem in the category.Best to get started. This is super cool to initiate & nurture reading habits into our little ones. Don't expect your tiny humans to show interest in reading at the very beginning. Allow them to explore the colour/images first. My 7 month old just loves to go through it for the vibrant colours.

    Images and their colors are very natural, paper quality is good and book are handy to be carried easily by kids. But a few vegetable varieties, and their names; some English words , are not common to India. For example, instead of aeroplanes, they have give airplane; and colors teaching book is not attracting my kid interest.

    My baby's first reaction to see this.. WowIt is very useful for kids n very worth in this price, it's hard cover can keep it long but if you have more naughtiest kid then it can use for 3 months too as attached the pictures are after 8 months but good thing is that now my 23 months old baby knows various animals n learnt all colour ,shapes, a to z, 1 to 10, and he knows the difference between farm n wild animals, and amazing thing is that he doesn't habbit of mobile tab or any other gadgets

    Nice product for small babies. You should buy this when your baby is just 1 yr old and he will start liking it and can enjoy it upto 3 yrs or more also. It has animals, fruits, numbers, transportation etc books. Your kid will get familiar with all these things. And most important , develop a love of reading, touching and enjoying books. The product is small, curved corners so that your baby will play and don't get harmed. A must buyüòçüòç

    This set of 10 books is what my three-year-old always asks for, everytime I open my cupboard. This package includes a set of 10 pocket sized cardboard books, one each for fruits, vegetables, modes of transport, wildlife, domestic animals,birds, shapes, colors, numbers, and A to Z. The pics are crystal clear, bright and attractive. Overall quality of the book is worth spending your bucks!The only two negative things I found is that the book consists of all things American. I doubt if parents in India will be able to relate to many fruits, veggies, animals shown in this book, which are not found in India. Can't blame the publisher, as the book set is imported from US.Secondly, I thought the book is of full size, of around the size of an A4 page, but the package arrived too small. It is infact pocket sized books for kids. Otherwise, truly a delight for the little ones to learn while they play! Thumbs Up!

Books are just perfect for your small kid. They will play with them as small objects initially & then eventually they will start learning to turn on pages & see different images which are of good color quality. When they grow up, the same set of book will serve as good vocabulary source for learning.

Books are durable too and can take a beating, tantrums, fingering and even a bit of soaking and still last.The syllabus is interesting to. Its a bit Canadian I think, yet relevant for Indians. Would buy more from this publisher for sure. 100% recommended. Buy it for a kid in the family or for a friend's kid as a gift.

Thats also nicely designed.

    This set of books is very cute. Handy and is of good quality. My son loved flipping through the pages and stopping at a certain page and I told the name of the fruit/object/animal on that page. It's a fun way to teach our kids. They'll be attracted to the colourful pictures.

The only drawback is the box witdh is a little less that the books fits very tightly inside and my baby couldn't pull out the book by herself untill I help her. So my suggestion is to wonder house books please increase box witdh a little so the toddlers can put and take out the books easily from the box.

    Books are made of hard cardboard type paper. Good for small kids, as they have tendency to tear pages. It's good If pages are made up of waterproof material. Books are small in size but good quality pictures.Due to it's small size kids can handle them easily. Nice start to reduce screen time for kids.

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    Good quality board books. My 2 year old was really excited seeing it and she loves it. The packing and print quality is also very good. Only thing they could have included nursery rhymes as one book instead of farm animals or wild animals or transport. That is why it is rated 4 stars.

    A simple book series with a picture and word per page (except for the abc book's last few crowded pages). A child can learn and improve his/her vocabulary with this series. The pages are completely worn out due to heavy usage almost everyday. A warning for the parents!!!. Be prepared to read this book again and agian with your baby since they may ask for you to read them every single day for more than five to six times!!! For a complete look of the set visit my YouTube channel - gforgratitude, i have fliped through the pages from the whole set.A small thing that i found is that, there are two styles of this book series, with same content but in a different font and picture layout style. So, you may get a random set.

    Actually product quality is good but problem is in every picture their is similarity or repetition of pictures for eg in fruits u normally get to see fruits thats right but in numerical again fruits are repeated so the basic concern is grasping gets confusing for child as vocal sounds are different for same picture ie- 1 numb you see one apple and so on so if that is being rectified the product can be eligible for 5 star. Minor things but it has a huge impact

    I bought this book a few days ago,when I received it I was amazed to see the quality,the round edges,glossy finish,naturalization,color,size,combination well though out book for children definitely a buy if you children at home,any children loving parents would love it,it is the best alternative of mobile phones,children love it,learn from reading books.Seller part.The image is a bit mis-leading it looks like A4,but actually it is smaller than post card size. I think seller should change the images shown on Amazon website.Amazon is always the best in delivering the item in well packed and on time.Thank you,For making your customers smiling like your company log.

    Bought this for my 1.5 year old boy. He loves these books! We read these everyday and he doesn't get bored looking through the same books over and over again (especially the transport book!). He's already learning and recognizing so many new things. This is such a healthy distraction from cartoons/mobile/TV.Pros:- board books, so will not tear bend easily- rounded edges, will not hurt the child- colourful clear images on every page- 10 topics, so lots to learn- pocket size, so easy to carry aroundLovely set of books to keep your child engaged. I've ordered the second set as well!

In the Number book, Numbers given 1 to 20 only. Limited content available.e. My 4 years baby all ready knows more than given in these books. So, more suitable for more younger kids.

Shapes, vegetables, transport & colors books cannot be used now as my daughter is just turning a year old but can be used later. In the books for eg. Animal books animals like llama in bird book emu, hornbill; how can 1 year old understand that, books should be simpler for them to understand. I think buying all the books is not needed at once.
