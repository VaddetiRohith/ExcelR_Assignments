    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone .

This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.

Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding. Crease same as before nothing changes. Slightly minor scratches on screen occurred just like normal phone. My daily screen on time is 10 hours and 50 to 70 times fold . Enjoying phone . By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

By the way photo was taken with this phone and she is my wife. Will give you next update after 6 months.Update after 4 monthsCrease as it is not any issues. Enjoying phone as usual. Slight and minor scratch on protective layer. But reiterate display has as it is. Overall great experience.

    What I think the most is that this beautiful device is targeted at females, got one for my wife surely it's an added accessory for her so slick and beautiful camera is really good, worth the price

    The durability and performance of the device is amazing and i am a heavy user and with my kind of use i am left with about 25-30% battery at the end of the day! How amazing is that and must say the phone looks and feels pretty dope and is a definite attention graber!

    Update1. Many  people has claimed including my friend that even if screen stop working due to Samsung fault, they will not provide warranty even though minor scratches on screen Samsung service centre count as void of warranty and you have to pay additional 30k for screen replacement. I think Samsung should provide 2 year warranty on foldable phone screen otherwise it is very risky within 1 year if phone stop working due to manufacturing defect or the way foldable phone design you will have to bear the cost even though you have paid 1 lakh rupees. Keep in mind  by the way 1 month passed i have no any issues but people say problem occurred after 6 months.Initial reviewI'm thrilled with experience especially the cover display. Download cover screen os app and enjoy YouTube, chrome and more on cover screen which samsung by default not provide. Phone is better than iPhone to flaunt.Update10 days passed no issues happy with phone. Samsung should provide atleast free case with this phone. I was going to buy apple after using 5 year Samsung phone. But again i fall in love with Samsung due to flip.  Also Apple is not useful for me as i have to edit videos and download extensive app and i get moded version and other customisation so Android is perfect for me. This phone need to be charged twice a day. I set this phone charging capicuty at 85 percentage and in normal use it last for full 12 hr no issues. Display is awesome, camera is awesome. I like It's front camera quality very must. Let's see what happens with the middle creases. I open and close approx 50 times a day.Update after 3 monthsNo any issues on screen and folding.
