    Hi, I bought this during mid of covid second wave in India, Ofcourse due to restrictions Bosch people were not able to install, I had to get someone from Urban Company to do it, while they helped online, which is fine.The product is very good quality one and no noise and so silent.Just a week around Dussehra, we had a small short circuit due to apartment transformer issue which burnt the wire of washing machine. Technician came immediately and checked and said it will take 3 days. We requested if they can close it before Dussehra, they said it will take 3 days. After 3 days we did not see anyone coming, we called on 4 th day, now they added 2 more days to cover their weekend time as well and said, it will come on Monday.The problem with Bosch service is its company owned unlike IFB which gives it to third party.Here third parties compete to provide you service, where as Bosch service people will take their own sweet time if there are holidays are around.Think about this before buying this product.

    Product is perfect and noise levels are pretty low. Hardly you will notice that it is running in the wash mode which is primarily due to the inverter motor. We had IFB for a long time and was looking for a replacement with inverter motor and purchased this one.About VECARE free installation service. Trust me - They should be named as ""Don't Care"" for the pathetic service which I never got and only messages stating that site is not ready. Till date they never ever called to check whether the installation was done or not. Once the product is delivered, without wasting a minute, call up Bosch and schedule a free & professional installation service. Amazon completely let me down here that you were happily seeing the reschedules and never bothered to check whether the installation was done or not. I know it is a fulfilled service but cant be unattended and there is no contact number or an escalation # provided for Vcare other than the technician who never bothered to return the call.Word of caution: Pls don't try to run the machine without the technician as the drum is locked for safety purposes which is mentioned in the manual. I was about to do that mistake because the technician never turned up but luckily read the manual and waited.Overall, good product and working well!!

    Noise level is very minimal. Only suggestion to our new buyer is that plz call for installation from Bosch service centre ONLY. DON'T use the Amozon service centre which is though free but worst service provided. DON'T buy the installation service at the time of machine. Overall the machine is worth buying. Always buy 7 kg if u have baby in your house.

    Very good performance. Clothes are cleaned in a satisfying manner. It is so SILENT that we cant even make out that it is Running. It has a number of washing options. Average wash time is 45 mins. It has 2 sections for detergent and 1 for conditioner. So it is able to use fresh detergent in 2 separate cycles.NOTE : Please check water pressure before buying. It may not work with low water pressure.Overall a very good buy. Absolutely value for money.

    Great purchase! Very satisfied! It costed me ‚Çπ29000 after credit card discount. Here's my experience so farPros:1. Very silent and stable-No noise to little2.Excellent Wash quality ( Even whites)3. Less water consumption4. 5 star Ratings hence less electricity consumption( I have used for 15days and no significant increase in bill amount as of now.. Will update after 2-3 months)5. Very sturdy and stylishCons:1.Needs high pressure at inlet( It costed me extra ‚Çπ300 to install new valve)2. Short inlet pipe( No issue for me)3. Installation and Demo was very late for me( No service center in my city)4.Stand and cover is very costly‚Çπ4000 & ‚Çπ800 respectively ( though quality is very good I found them on little pricier side) Some cons which we can ignore Strightaway. If your budget permits just go for it.

    My experience has been good overall with this washing machine. However there is something important you should know regarding the repairability.After 4-5 years if the drum gets damaged due to any reason then, Bosch will only replace the complete drum instead of repairing it at a cost of rs.10,000/- to 14,000/- because it is a sealed drum that cannot be disassembled. My friend faced this issue and has to replace the shock absorbers, drum and related parts for a total of Rs.15KIt seems these companies were fined by the EU to stop making sealed drums that Cannot be repaired.Online reviews suggest LG makes repairable drums. Though I like Bosch as a brand and the overall quality of the washing machine is good I would not recommend purchasing it, if it is very expensive to repair.Now I am just hoping that I do not face this problem in the future.

    32000 for 7kg machine, after that you need to buy 4000 bosch stand, 800 rs cover, 600 for 2 litre only special detergent, Special tap 3/4 grade etc. After you do all this and start washing clothes, it will show low water pressure error. Such fancy products not fit for Indian homes. Though quality of wash appears to be slightly better than top load. It consumes very less water so you r left in doubt whther clothes r rinsed properly or not. So use only liquid detergent.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    ¬†I am writing this review after 3 days of using.Addition things required for this machine if you have been using front load washin machine or you are going to purchase new washing machine first time. Things like new two way tap for machine filter. This machine needs filter which can only be use through new tap connection. You need plumbing services for this. Secondly company provides only 1m pipe so if yor distance between tap and washing machine is more the  you required brand new pipe from bosh which cost around Rs 950. Third is discal liquid for drum clean. Its mandatory because executive from bosh said after three wash you need to clean drum for first time then you can clean after 4 to 5 months frequency, but its cost around Rs 2500 and last but not least no other washing machine stand is suitable for this heavy machine and specially wheel based stand. You need only OG stand which company provides which cost around Rs 3000.

    The machine is being used at two places by my relatives with very good reviews. Hence I went ahead and purchased the same. However the technician who came to install declared that the machine won‚Äôt run at my first floor apartment due to low water pressure. He recommended installing a booster pump (some additional 7-8k) for proper operation of the machine. Now I was stuck with a defunct machine which was brand new but won‚Äôt run at my particular apartment.I contacted Amazon customer care regarding this issue, who initially refused to return the device. Next they informed me regarding visit by an Amazon technician who would certify that tha water pressure was actually low for operation and gave me a window of 4-6 days.Unfortunately nobody turned up from Amazon‚Äôs side and the return window was about to close. On contacting them again via telephone, the customer support team understood my problem and helped initiate the return process. The matter was handled very well by the Amazon support team and my machine was successfully returned.I appreciate the professional support provided by Amazon in this matter and the standard of their great support team.For all reading this review, please get water pressure measured by a qualified technician before you order the machine. Bosch machines have this peculiar requirement which may pose a problem to potential customers.I thank the Amazon team for their professional support in my case.

Really the washing work done by the machine is excellent. It's very easy to use because of the various programmes depending upon the laundry. Eventhough the water is somewhat hard, because of the inbuilt heater available in the machine, the dirt removed thoroughly and the clothes looks shining. Thanks to Bosch for their inventory adopted in this washing machine.

    I tell u honestly, market is flooded with autom machines, at huge marketing gimmicks, don't fall for it, Bosch technology is apar, from other manufacturers, the noise level is so calm, that sometimes we even forget that machine is running, until the final alarm buzzes.Washing is so easy to operate as per indian mothers, it's very very easy to remember and operate..no confusion at all.Quality of washing is very neat, do as per the modes given, bt one advice always keep the rpm at 800-1000, for cloth quality to be long life ..Consumption of watr and electricity is bery less as compared to our last LG semi automatic machine.IM IN LOVE WITH BOSCH , PLANNING TO PURCHASE THE DISHWASHER TOO...ALL THE BEST .

    Using it for past 6 months. Working well and washing is also very good compared to top load which I had earlier. Initially it used to vibrate a lot when drying, which i resolved via buying plastic circular stand which cost less then 150Rs.Also another problem that it too heavy approx 100 kg. We need to put load of efforts to take it to second floor.Note do not try to open or install by your self wait for service man, otherwise you may damage it.Overall I happy to have it

    ¬†I have used ifb for last 7 years .It has less maintainance for starting 4 years upto warranty then it will give more maintainance cost.I have taken Bosch 7 kg last 7 days and it is working fine it has eco silence drive that will reduce noise level in washing and spinning. Built quality well compared to IFB. less water as well as power consumption due to 1200 rpm. Didn't know maintaince cost but really value for money. So go for it.

    I have been using this product for over a month now for a family of 3. I must say it's an excellent product from the performance point of view. The noise level is really low that you will not feel that the machine is switched on or off. The machine is very sturdy that you will not feel any kind of vibration when the machine is in wash/spin mode. The Bosch service center person was really helpful in installation and he did not compel me to buy any of his additional products. Overall a good product as per my usage.

    The machine is great. It's very simple and easy to use. The noise levels are at minimum when it's not placed on a stand.The technician who came for setup also sold a stand(not from bosch) at a price of 2k. The washing machine was extremely shaky and too noisy when kept on a stand. The technician refused to take the stand back.. Hence we have removed the stand and let the machine operate without the stand. Don't be conned by the techs on the stand. Infact Bosch should make it clear if it's recommended to use a stand.

    This is one of the best f/l w/m available in the market, but price is quite high. Original cover & stand are very expensive. I think the length of water inlet pipe should be more. Over all the product is superb.
  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After using for 10 days it can be said that it is a good product at the price point of 30k. During wash cycle you will most probably wont notice that its on, due 2 low noise level. However, during spin at 1200 or 1000 rpm, its vibration is noticeable. Its not a dryer but does its job....hardly 50 to 60% drying. Hope there was anti wrinkle feature with anti tangle. One annoying thing is that water inlet pipe is so small in length, i hv 2 buy it seperately. Cheap marketing tactics for a company like Bosch...!!! Also check ur washing machine tap, if it is 1 inch dia outer thread tap, filter will fit. Otherwise suitable adapter will be required. Details available in Bosch site.

    We did not buy a front load washing machine for a king time thinking that the water pressure in our tap would not be enough.

The 6kg version is cheaper by 6k inr.

    Very worst washing machine. Do not buy Bosch as this model has issues in drawing water. How much ever good pressure is there , the water tap indictor will turn on and will also keep warning. The filters they out basically slows down the flow.There is no motor to suck the water and the pipes connecting the tap to the detergent box is installed upward inclination and the water pressure becomes so low. This total waste of money.After few months of purchase the machine started to drip water inside the drum. Very bad engineering, not suitable for Indian households. It's a failed engineering by Bosch. I wish I have negative review. Not worth for a one star. My earlier LG machine ran for 11 years and still was sold for second use. It did not develop any water pressure issues.

    Bosch products are quite good. We have used many of the appliances from this brand.We were really excited to buy this washing machine however the seller and the Amazon delivery person did not accept the IFB senator washing machine which is on working condition. They did not take it as exchange, a customer spends him time and money in buying things. Kindly give feedback to the seller team.

    This is my second washing machine and before this I was using Samsung Top loading machine. Ofcourse Bosch is a premium band so when I decided to change my washing machine it was first on my list. After debating a lot between top and front loading machine I chose to go ahead with front loading machine. The only problem I have is it always says the water pressure is low (the indication glows) and the time taken also changes. It will indicate 2 mins to complete then suddenly it will change to 8 mins.The machine is quite heavy so unless you have a lift or live in ground floor do not buy this. The delivery people also say they are allowed to carry it only till first floor if there are no lifts.The installation happened promptly performance wise its doing well so far. Should see how it does in the long run.

    Declaration: I didn't buy it from Amazon. Brought it from authorized dealer in my local.Good things: Low noise, smooth.Bad things: low water pressure error. This model is definitely have some design problem. Not well suitable for Indian home water system. Even Bosh website and machine manual says10 liters per minute is sufficient to get it operated, but in reality it is not. I have more than 12 liters per min flow at my tap, water tank installed above 15 feelt from ground still facing low water pressure. This causes more cleaning time that defined for cycle. All cycles do not complete in given time.In short : if you are having overhead tank for water supply which is less than 15 feet heigh, don't go for Bosh series 4, 7 kg front load. May be you can think of lower kg ot alternate brand suitable for Indian household plumbing with over head tank.

    Want to caution here innocent buyers looking at number of stars given with no doubt the good performance BUT Bosch have made the drum sealed so you cannot service a bearing or spider arm replacement but have to replace the complete drum, my 6kg machine bought in Amazon for Rs.16k I thought was wonderful deal only to be cheated by Bosch in 3 years the drum needed to be replaced because it cannot be service as it is moulded/pasted two halves and cannot be split easily to enable service.  They have cunningly designed the machine nice but to keep up their returns by service, this is like printers where you pay small price for whole printer but huge price for ink. Please check first if the drum can be servived before buying washing machine. I feel cheated and will never go to Bosch again.

    Using this machine since 3 years now. The product is really good and I had no issues with it. But I must say Bosch has a pathetic customer service. The knob of my machine got damaged and asked for repair in end May 2021. Till date the part is not repaired. It's been months. Moreover, what they keep doing is one POC gives the contact of other and it keeps happening and the issue does not get solved. I recommend not to buy products from Bosch. There are other companies in market with good products and better customer service.

    Complete water is not routed correctly to the exit always. We could see water stagnant above the rubber as well as between the rubber layers all the time. This makes formation of dirt above the rubber layers and this making the life of rubber lesser.Also the fragrance liquid dispenser went unfunctional after a year which is very disappointing for the high value paid for buying.

    I have a bosch automatic washing machine purchased in 2015. The machine showed some  issues, so shock absorbers were changed. After 3 months, machine made huge sound at drying cycle. The technician said drum is to be changed @ Rs 9265. On going through the net, I found that bearing has failed and it can not be changed singly as it comes in a package of drum & bearing. Usually, after 7 years of use bearing fail in most machines and in case of bosch, need to pay unnecessary additional charge of changing the drum too.

    ¬†I purchased a 7 kg Bosch washing machine just a 3 years back. Wish to share some feedback as follows:-1. Noisy one2. It takes more than 1 hr for a washing cycle3. Got repaired in 2 years for over vibration and sound. Spent around 1700 rs for repairing it4. Now spin is not working5. Lack of spare parts availability6. Maintenance cost is so high7. After all very worst service supportACCORDING TO ME BUYING BOSCH WASHING MACHINE IS WASTE OF MONEY

    The noise level is too low, and very fast quality washing comparing my ifb aqua SX model. Also the installation person from Bosch was very polite and had a good helping mentality. He suggested to use our existing hose ( IFB) to avoid buying an adaptor for fixing the hose, till my current hose is worn out. He took time to explain all operations patiently and was almost there tilll an entire quick wash completed. He introduced us with the Bosch descaling powder and the extended warranty, but did not aggressively insist me to buy those( IFB) persons are notoriously bad with pushing their descaling powder. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.ConsProduct has only 2 years warranty compared to ifbs. However I was able to get an extended warranty of 3 more years(1699)Amazon delivery agents were not very polite. They were not ready to keep the mchine on first floor, and suggested that the Bosch personnel will be doing that. I firmly said that they can take back the machine if they are not ready to place it on first floor. So was not happy about Amazon delivery. Giving 5* rating since I don't want to penalize Bosh over this issue.

    So yes, lets talk about hits first:1. Good washing quality2. Quite a few washing options3. Good Build quality4. Less noise level5. Temperature settingMisses:1. Amazon installation service is a biggest letdown. Didn't turned up on sceduled time and date and ultimately have to self call Bosch service center to fix appointment. I have spent my 2 days explaining this issue to Customer care but even then noone turned up on said date. Its better to either buy product offline or call Bosch customer care for installation. Bosch installation team came the next day, so that's the good part.2. Their accessories are quite expensive, so it's upto u if you buy from outside. I bought directly from them (stand) as build qualityu of the stand was good. Bosch can lower the accessories price, so that's a miss.3. I felt built quality, especially upper part just average. Reason , at first when i received this product, it was damaged from upper part. And it can be easily pressed if u put any heavy pressure. Although, machine weight is quite heavy but that may be because drum and motor.4. Inlet pipe is too short. Whomsoever designed this, should keep at least 2 m of pipe, this one was just 1 meter. U will have to purchase the pipe from outside if distance is over 1 meter ....Overall good product, but my preferance would be to not rely on Amazon installation and directly book from Bosch.

    The washing machine is a good buy. Noise level very low as compared to other automatic machines. Smooth operation. Only thing which bothered me that the person who came for installation charged an amt of 380 INR for a simple connector available for 100 INR in the market. I didn‚Äôt receive any bill also for it. Otherwise the person was helpful and helped me getting it installed on a trolly.

    We are using Bosch washing machine since 2 years. We have ordered this new one, and surprisingly this machine came with more stable functionalities and very minimal noise. The quality of washing is at It's high and the sound is as less as you have to check weather machine is running or not.If you are looking for any 7kg mid size front load machine then go for it. In this price range this a best value for money product.

    I wish I had replaced my old I** washing machine which used to shake my entire building and super sonic sound. In contrast, this 7 Kg fully automatic washing machine from Bosch is a sheer joy. I don't even know whether clothes are being washed even while sitting at a distance of 3 meters. I was apprehensive to order on Amazon as I thought that it is I who will have to contact Bosch for the installation. However, on the contrary, I got a call from Bosch on the very next day of the delivery. The service engineer asked me whether I had water connection? I sent him photograph of the existing water point. He asked me to get a 0.5 inch to 0.75 inch adapter. I requested him to get it himself. He came installed the machine and provided demo. So, delivery to installation  in 2 days. EXTREMELY HAPPY TO HAVE BOUGHT THIS MACHINE. Just go for it. Bosch is a great company.

Had multiple follow up and warning over the email but no action taken by Bosch. As it‚Äôs a washing machine so not able to maintain hygiene and kids got sick.Strongly advise to not buy any product from Bosch. They don‚Äôt have any service infrastructure and also not having justified customer care.
